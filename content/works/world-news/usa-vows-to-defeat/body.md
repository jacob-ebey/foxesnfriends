# U.S. Vows To Defeat Whoever Their Enemy Is

WASHINGTON, DC—In a televised address to the American people Tuesday, a determined President Trump vowed that the U.S. would defeat "whoever exactly it is we're at war with here."

It was Steve Mnuchin’s birthday and as a special surprise planed out by Trump himself, Steve got to pick between an ice cream social at Mar A Lago and a drone strike. With Steve’s history of intolerance towards minorities and lactose it was no surprise he went with a drone strike.

Trump went on to say, “Since we didn’t have any immediate threats we went to the hat full of business cards from middle eastern warlords - we tell them they could win a prize package from Haliburton but that’s a lie.”

After a few more minutes of basking in his successful strike, Trump turned to Mark A. Milley, the rarely seen Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and had him go fetch the hat with the names of Americas’ top targets.

“We have the best hats! Magical hats!”, Trump says before he proceeds to turn to the news cameras and say “This is how we picked Soleimani. It was a very unbiased selection. Leave the biases to crooked CNN, am I right? Should we pick the next target now?… Yeah, sound fun?… No, I was told we have to keep this a secret, but be assured I’m dedicated to defeating whoever exactly it is we’re at war with here.”

After a collective sigh from the intelligence members present, secret service escorted the president back to his bouncy castle that was inflated earlier that day on the front lawn of the White House, where he received his daily dose of entertainment turning away children of color.
