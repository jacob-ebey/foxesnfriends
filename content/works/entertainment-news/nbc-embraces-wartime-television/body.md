Bridgeport, VA—NBC starts the new year strong capitalizing on the rise of Islamophobia with the release of their newest chapter in the Law & Order series: "Law & Order: Muslim Victims Unit".

The latest spinoff of Law & Order is focused around the new law enacted in West Virginia, entitled the “Sue Thy Neighbor - Keep the Minorities the Minorities” act. This bill, rushed through by Ralph Northam, does exactly what it states, allows you to sue your neighbor if they are a minority and you expect them of terrorism.

The episodes are packed full of nail biting moments. One episode in particular that stood out featured a wealthy family moving from San Francisco where the father had been a tech worker and the mother, a naturopathic physician. The episode opened with them driving across the country to Bridgeport, VA, where the family had bout a house sight unsean.

When the workers the family had hired to haul their posessions across the US had finished unloading the moving truck, and it pulled away into the distance, that’s when you saw it for the first time in the neighbors window, the burqa. **DUN DUN**
