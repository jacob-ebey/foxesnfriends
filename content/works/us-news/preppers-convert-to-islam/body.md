Mt. Hood, OR—In a sudden shift in mentality, Preppers throughout the Oregon state convert to Islam in hopes Iran will leave mosques alone.

With the realization there are no true cultural sites in the U.S, making predicting a target for a missile strike imposible, [Fortitude Ranch](https://fortituderanch.com/), in a last ditch effort to improve their chances of survial in all out war with Iran, have started urging their members to convert to Islam.

In the newsletter sent out shortly after the missile strike that killed Qasem Soleimani, Fortitude Ranch senior leadership wrote: “Converting to Islam will be equivilant to good camouflage. We estimate Mosques to be at the lowest risk of attack in the event of all out war with Iran.”

They go on to say that all Fortitude Ranch locations will remain great places to visit with the family outside of wartime, but they will no longer be serving pork products to “Maximize the effectivness of our newfound camouflage”.
